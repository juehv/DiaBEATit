# DiaBEATit Android App
This repository holds the code for the DiaBEATit App supporting our diabetes research.
It is based on the code from a "Bachelor Praktikum" I supervised in 2019 and the [AndroidAPS](https://github.com/MilosKozak/AndroidAPS) project.
The goal of the project was to collect and export data relevant for diabetes patients in a convenient way to support our diabetes research efforts.

Check the Wiki page for documentation.
Check our [website](https://diabeatit.de) for more information about the project.

## Make it compile
The DiaBEATit App uses the "chaquopy" library to run python algorithms within the app. Therefore you'll need to install python3 on your computer and tell chaquopy where to find it. Add the following to your `local.properties`:
```
chaquopy.license=YOUR-LICENSE-KEY
python.path=C:\\PATH\\TO\\python.exe
```
